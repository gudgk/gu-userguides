# Adding an Attendance activity

> To track attendance in Moodle, you must first add an Attendance activity to your course site.

**Step 1:** Go to the course homepage and click **Turn editing on**.

**Step 2:** Click **Add an activity or resource** in the section where you want to add the Attendance.

**Step 3:** Select **Attendance icon** Attendance and click **Add**.

> **Note:** You can make as many instances of the Attendance activity as you like. Each instance may have multiple different sessions.

**Step 4:** Enter a **Name**.

**Step 5:** Set the attendance grade:

**Note:** By default, Attendance will contribute to the course grade.

1. Click Grade

2. If you want Attendance to contribute to the course grade, set a Maximum points value. The default is 100.

3. If you do not want Attendance to contribute to the course grade, change the **Type** to **None** or **Scale**.

**Step 6:** Set other options as desired.

**Step 7:** Scroll down and click **Save and display**.

**Step 8:** Decide on attendance marking options.

By default, the Attendance activity gives you options to mark students as follows:

- Present (2 points)
- Late (1 point)
- Excused (1 point)
- Absent (0 points)

**Note on Point Values:** The point values for each session do not need to add up to the total point values you have assigned to Attendance as a whole. Example: You have 30 class sessions and you are using the default values of 2 points for each present attendance, but you want 100 points to be added to the gradebook for perfect attendance. If a student attends every session, they will receive a total of 60 attendance points out of 60 possible points. Moodle will convert this to 100 points for the gradebook. If a student misses half the sessions and therefore only earns 30 points out of a possible 60 attendance points, the student will receive 50 out of 100 points in the gradebook.

**Step 9:** Go on to Adding single or multiple sessions.
