# Taking attendance

**Step 1:** clicking on the **green radio** button on the session rectangle's right-hand side. Those sessions for which attendance has already been taken, do not have the green button. However, the description is a link that takes you to a screen for modifying the attendance record for that session.

**Step 2:** Mark the attendance.

> Note that when taking attendance, the column headings for attendance status are links. click one of these column headings, all students will have their status changed to the status you selected. Thus, if everyone is present, you can merely click the **P column** header to change everyone's status to "Present". If only one person is absent, you could first click P to set everyone's status to "Present", and then set the absent student's status to "Absent".

**Step 3:** Enter remarks as appropriate — for example, the reason for an absence if known, or the number of minutes a student was late — and click the **OK button** to record the information.
